I absolutely love that I sent you one of weirdest texts one can send to a girl, around this time, last year and it has mostly been all good since then.

Of course everything has not gone as I had planned but nothing does and I think nothing should. Anyway I am very grateful to you because you stayed throughout my worst days and been the one I could vent to without thinking twice. I dont think I would have been what I am going to be if you werent there.
You sent
Also if you have already forgotten I would like to remind you that I love you. And you don't need to worry about that because I don't do it myself. I will just let it be
You sent
I would obviously love it if we go back to how it used to be and i am waiting for it but even if the wait comes out to be worthless and I dont think it would be sad because I would love to have someone like you in my life anyway.
You sent
I just hope that you do know, for you I'd bleed myself dry because you're my yellow.</div>
